  <p>I have developed several tools related to baseball data and analysis that I have made available and maintain for public use.</p>
	<p><a href="https://BillPetti.github.io/baseballr">baseballr package for R</a>: baseballr is a package written for the R programming language focused on baseball analysis. It includes functions for scraping various data from websites, such as FanGraphs.com, Baseball-Reference.com, and baseballsavant.com. Sample functions include the ability to scrape MLB and NCAA pitcher and hitter data over custom ranges, calculate pitch tendencies to different parts of the strike zone, and calculate advanced metrics for user data sets.
	<p><a href="http://billpetti.shinyapps.io/shiny_spraychart">Interactive Spray Chart Tool</a>: An interactive spray chart tool built with R Shiny that uses batted ball data from MLBAM’s Gameday and Statcast systems. Data and tool is updated daily in season. Entire pipeline is written in R.
	<p><a href="https://billpetti.shinyapps.io/edge_shiny/">Edge% app</a>: An interactive web app built in R with Shiny. Data includes frequency of pitches to different areas of the strike zone for batters, pitchers, and teams since 2010. Also includes umpire called strike tendencies by area of the strike zone. The app updates daily through an R job, adding data from all games the night before during the season.
